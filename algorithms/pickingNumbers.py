# Given array of numbers
# - find max num of integers you can select from array such that the absolute
# > difference between the any two of the chosen are less than or equal to 1

# Example
# - array = [1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]
# - can create TWO sub-arrays
# 1. [1, 1, 2, 2] length = 4
# 2. [4, 4, 5, 5, 5] length = 5

# INPUT
# 1. single integer n (size of array)
# 2. n space separated integers a[i]
