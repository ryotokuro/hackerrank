# HackerLand Enterprise is adopting a new viral advertising strategy.
# When they launch a new product, they advertise it to exactly 5 people on social media.

# On the FIRST day, HALF of those 5 people
# *(ie floor(5/2) = 2)
# like it and share with 3 of their friends

# At the beginning of the SECOND day
# floor(5/2) * 3 = 2*3 = 6 people have received the advertisement

# EACH day, floor(recipients/2) of the recipients like the advertisement and will share with 3 friends the following day

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assuming nobody receives the advertisement twice,
# Determine how many people have liked the ad by the end of a given day, beginning with launch day as day 1.
