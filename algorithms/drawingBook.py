# Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their books to a page number. Brie can either
# start turning pages from the front of the book or from the back of the book. She always turns
# pages one at a time. When she opens the book, page 1 is always on the right side:
#
# When she flips page 1, she sees pages 2 and 3. Each page except the last page will always
# be printed on both sides. The last page may only be printed on the front, given the length
# of the book. If the book is n pages long, and she wants to turn to page p, what is the
# minimum number of pages she will turn? She can start at the beginning or the end of the book.
#
# The first line contains an integer n, the number of pages in the book.
# The second line contains an integer, p, the page that Brie's teacher wants her to turn to.
