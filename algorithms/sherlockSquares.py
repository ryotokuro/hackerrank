# BACKGROUND
# Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability.
# He will provide a starting and ending value describing a range of integers.
# Sherlock must determine the number of square integers within that range, inclusive of the endpoints.

# NOTE
# A square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer, e.g. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25

# EXAMPLE
# The range is a = 24 and b = 49, inclusive.
# There are three square integers in the range: 25, 36 and 49.

# FUNCTION DESCRIPTION
# Return an integer representing the number of square integers in the inclusive range from a to b.
# squares() has parameters:
#   - a: an integer, the lower range boundary
#   - b: an integer, the upper range boundary
