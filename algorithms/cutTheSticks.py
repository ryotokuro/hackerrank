# PROBLEM
# You are given a number of sticks of varying lengths. You will iteratively cut the sticks into smaller sticks,
# discarding the shortest pieces until there are none left. At each iteration you will determine the length of
# the shortest stick remaining, cut that length from each of the longer sticks and then discard all the pieces
# of that shortest length. When all the remaining sticks are the same length, they cannot be shortened so discard them.
