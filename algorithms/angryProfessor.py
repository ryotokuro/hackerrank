# A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of students.
# Frustrated with their lack of discipline,
# he decides to cancel class if fewer than some number of students are present when class starts.
# Arrival times go from on time (arrivalTime <= 0) to arrived late (arrivalTime > 0).

# INPUT FORMAT
# 1. t - number of test cases
# * Each test case consists of TWO lines

# First line has two SPACE-SEPARATED INTEGERS:
# - n, number of students in class
# - k, cancellation threshold

# Second line contains n space-separated integers (a_1, ... a_n)
# - describes arrival times for each student
